Hello Everyone, How have you been?

How are you? I'm fine, I just missed you so much. 

I hope every one of you feel good to be here today, and have very good body condition although we've been through tough time during the covid 19.

After we stop offline meeting of Toastmasters, many things have changed in my life, my daughter who used to be very small before covid, now become the most talkative person in my family. Sadly my father passed away during the covid season last year. My dear friend Dev left Samsung HQ and joined Samsung Research in India.

I think it's not only me who had many changes, if you go out, people still wear mask, remote work become one of the most common working type now, how about the life? home training became the biggest booming last year, although it's not like that now. Metabus is rasing as promising tech because people realized that they can have situation like covid 19 anytime in the future. 

I can see the people in Toastmaster has changed and the tools that we are using for the meeting is changed.

I think it may not be only me who feels that things are changed in life after the covid.

how about you Simon, is there anything changed in your life in last 2 years?

how about you Jinyoung?

I think it's really true that the only thing that does not change is the fact that everything will change.

you know what? I missed this moment very much, the time that I can talk with beloved people, the time that I can enjoy the moment with people who pursue to grow.

Toastmasters meeting in last 2 year has also changed a lot I think, many people left because they preper the offline meeting, and many people joined online meeting for the club in other country. 

I think I also enjoyed those a lot. 

Did you enjoy the changes? how about something not changed?

I think I saw the article saying that the reason why the travel is good is because we have home to come back. You enjoy the changes or different view or something new in your traveling.. but because you have cosy home to come back, you feel great and you are ready to take the adventure.

and I think.. dear toastmasters, you are at home now, I now you are very tired of being away and trying to do something others during the long long travelling to somewhere, finally you are at home now.

so do not afraid of doing others but here, you have friends and beloved one, so make your self comfortable and enjoy time with them.

and why don't you start with "How are you my friend?"

Thanks.
