There is a community, normally, no body ask you what to do and no body push you to complete whatever it is, so sometimes, people like me is feeling that maybe I should ask them to do something.

But in this community, there are a few people doing something strange.

They prepare things by themselves, study what they like and share it when it’s completed, they even help others to do the same. When there is something that they think good then they share their thought and review with others. They love to be there so they try to keep this community.
Can you guess what it is? Yes, it’s Toastmasters.
 

Since I started it on 2012, it's been more than 12 years. Some people ask me "why are you doing this?" no body pay for you doing it, and I even know that some people used their own money to do things for others.

I thought about it many times, why?, but there wasn’t clear answer to me.

Simply put, I just wanted to keep this community because I feel that I’m respected and valued when I’m here. And I feel that I’m needed here by others which means I can contribute to this organization and to the people. So I can say that I see the reason of my being.

But~~ It's not that simple right? I know, with this amount of money I spend, I can subscribe Netflix, so, I can’t say it’s that much good or not.

Because I still had doubt on my answer and couldn't stop looking for the answer, at least better answer than what I said.
However, I found one book and it gave me a hint, so let me introduce you this book

"Courage to be disliked"
 
It's about Alfred Adler, who is the founder of Individual Psychology.

I would like to introduce one of the most famous theory from him.

“Deny the trauma, when people said there is reason (past experiences) and the result (now), he said, you create the reason because you want this result.”

It means, if you are the person who believe in that past experiences decide who you are now, you see the world as a leaner line, like past is shaping your present or future. In this theory, everything is connected, and important thing is, because you cannot change the past, you may not be able to change the future, because it's all connected.
However, Alfred Adler is saying exactly opposite. He said people are making excuse or reason because they want something. Past is just something that happened before but it cannot do anything to what I do in the future.
Then he gave this example, you may think that the person with trauma will suffer, then everyone with same trauma such as child abuse, sexual abuse, bully from the school, critical injury of body in early childhood should end up same.
But there are people who step up from that trauma, they overcome it and some of them even say that success in their life was because they had pain in their past.
He is saying that if you are making excuse of not to do something now then it’s because you don't want to change. You just feel like stay in current status, maybe because it's more comfortable, or maybe it's safer, or maybe you are afraid of trying something new

You may deny it, “I didn’t want this!, I want to change!”, but deep down of your heart, you may fear to change because the current status may give you comfort, because you love to stay in possibility, not reality.

The fear is one of the reason you cannot get out of your comfort zone.
He is saying that it's your choice that makes your future, if you choose to become happy, then everything that happen before will be just a story and what shape your future will be based on what you do from now, maybe you will say some day 

“I could be like now because of those painful past”.

Fellow Toastmasters, to tell you the truth, I do not know which theory is right or better, but for me I like the one from Adler better because it means, I can do anything if I decide now, I choose to become toastmasters 12 years ago, and I have never regret doing it, because I learned how to talk, what to enjoy, and I've met plenty of beautiful people like you.
And It was all my choice. I think I couldn’t stop because I realized the joy that I can get from this choice.
Maybe you are in the middle of making choice now, if you fear it or afraid of not succeeding it. Look into the deep down of your heart and say to yourself 

“it’s ok, it will only make you better when you make a right choice, but if you decided not to, I know you might have hundred thousand of reason, but you will remain the same”.

So, now it’s time to make choice, what’s your choice?
Thanks.
