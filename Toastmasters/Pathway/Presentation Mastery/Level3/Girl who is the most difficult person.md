The most difficult person to persuade in the world


It's my daughter.

Especially the 2nd one.

When she was first born, I was so happy. she had this weird hairs like a lion at that time.

I thought what on earth, baby can have this much hairs. but it was so cute so I couldn't say anything.

Later on, when I was able to have conversation, I found that she was very independant.

I think it was like when she was around 4 years old.

Since that time, she's been very difficult.

when there is something I want her to do, such as 구몬 학습 or washing, brushing the teeth, most of the time she did but when we tried to inspect the result of what she did.

she started say no to all.


and if I become angry, she start cries. It was last weekend when my wife told me to handle her.

I asked her, what do you want me to do?

and she said, your daughter need to complte 구몬학습 of friday and saturday. make sure it's completed by today.


I know she never likes doing 구몬학습, but the problem I had appointment on saturday evening 1 hour before when my dauther goes to sleep. So, I felt hurry.

my wife also asked me that there is a homework from school which is about visiting hompage of school and find a answer for the questions related to the school.

I become even worried because small one become already irritated by what her mom said in front of her.

I asked the little one to come and visit the school home page but she is saying no with her eyes.


At first, I was not upset, but as time goes by little one become more and more grumpy.

we had arguing about whether she should write clearly on the paper for the homework but she said it's ok because teacher only ask her to read not submit the paper.

when I look back, it may not be something that much irritating. but I become so upset that I yell at her.

things went wrong from that times.


usually daily 구몬학습 took around 20~30 mins but this time it took more than 2 hours and she was crying all these time.

She said dady's yelling made her feel very sad and she couldn't play during day time.

ha.. I said many times to her that if you complete what you are asked, you are free to do anything..
but she didn't listen to it.

from this episode of my life, I've learned 2 things

1st, I get angry when my daughter does not follow what I asked her. Although this is important, I should understand she will never listen to me unless she agree that it's important.

2nd, nothing works when you girl become emotional. 

There are life of mine and life of small girl and both are important. And balancing them is not easy and always
I should check the emotional status of girls first before ask her if I want to complete it by the time I need it.
