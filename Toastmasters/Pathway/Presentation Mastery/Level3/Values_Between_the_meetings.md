Previously, in Pathway, there was some missing part.  
Is there anyone who noticed about it? What we do most frequently but never mentioned about it.  
It's Roles, Timer, Ah Counter, Grammarian, Table Topic Master, and so on.  
So, here is Pathway with roles. (show the system)  
When you first came to the Toastmaster meeting, 9 out of 10 are saying that they will join again to improve their English.  
But do you know what you realized after 6 months or a year? Maybe sooner than that.  
1 meeting a week can't change anything.  
- Life Goes On by BTS  
Is there anyone who knows this song?  
"  
끝이 보이지 않아, 출구가 있긴 할까? 발이 떼이질 않아, 않아  
잠시 두 눈을 감아, 여기 내 손을 잡아  
저 미래로 달아나자  
"  
When I first heard about this song, it didn't mean much to me. I liked the lyrics and rhythm.  
But that was it. I was not a big fan of BTS. I just thought this is kind of one of the good songs in the world.  
Have you ever had an experience of watching a movie or listening to one song one day, since then the scene from it or saying from them  
hovering in your head for a long time?  
You didn't think it mattered, but while you are talking with other people, you realized that it meant so much that you changed your attitude in life.  
As a Coach, I have a dream. One day, I can be the person who can guide people to the place where they never thought about or let them  
go through the time where they can find courage to the solution of problems in their life.  
But, life is not that simple, and those movies or songs just come to your life maybe once in a lifetime or twice.  
Other than that, you just move on, like a normal day. Get up in the morning, have a meal, and do what you need to do.  
While I was training myself to become a professional coach, I got to know that what you do in an hour with your client  
may have an impact on them, but you can't expect an "aha" moment all the time.  
Even if I become a great person who can do whatever necessary to myself or my client, at the end of the day,  
it's like one of the movies or songs you listen to.  
It may have an impact, but most of the time, it can be just one of the good movies or songs.  
Although I think coaching itself or a good movie or song itself has its value, but compared to your life, it's just very small.  
Like the title of the BTS song, life goes on.  
"  
아무일도 없단 듯이 또 하루 더 날아가지  
"  
On Monday of this week, I got to know that it's time to deliver my speech on the meeting, and I was feeling hesitant.  
I had something in my head like there is a new curriculum in Pathway that people may need to know in the Toastmaster journey.  
So, I chose it to tell you, but looking back the time of years, reminding myself with what kind of feeling the SOTM member has toward Pathway,  
I felt like, does it mean anything?  
Maybe life moves on like a normal day, changing nothing, having no impact on you.  
Then on Monday, I heard an amazing speech, and one of the phrases caught my ear.  
Between the meetings.  
Like I said, your life values much more, higher than something in the system or what I say today.  
But if there is anyone who decides to learn from it in their life and practice on the stage every meeting,  
I think their life can move to a different direction. I may not be able to change your life with what I show today,  
but if it slightly changes the direction of life, just for one person, I may be a meager person. But this speech is worth trying.  
I hope many people see the values of between the meetings.
