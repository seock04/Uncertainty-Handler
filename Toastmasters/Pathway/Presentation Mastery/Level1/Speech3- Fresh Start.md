Did you know that when people think of "hope" they are not even considering it to be happening more than 50%.
Which means, they know that it may not come true although they do their best.

But isn't it amazing how hope can move people forward even in this kind of situation? 
as you know, some hope do come true because the people who had that hope usually did whatever they can to make it possible.  

How about when you plan to do something?

In my case, I used to think about the expected result even before I start. I think of what I have to do and time need to do, money and energy that I have to use to up to the end of that result. 

Do you know what happen after that, fear comes in when I think of them.
What If I fail to do it? My parents, My friends or co-workers may be disappointed and think of me as looser because they see I couldn't make it.

Once this kind of thought process settle in your life, you life can easily get stuck, because like I said, there is always posibillity that you may fail, but not because you are not good enough, but mostly because your fear stop you to act.
