Did you know that when people think of "hope" they are not even considering it to be happening more than 50%.
Which means, they know that it may not come true even when they do their best.

But isn't it amazing how hope can move people forward, in this kind of situation? 
as you know, some hope do come true because the people who had that hope usually did whatever they can to make it possible.  

How about when you plan to do something?

In my case, I used to think about the expected result even before I start. I think of what I have to do and time need to do, money and energy that I have to use, up to the end of that result. 

Do you know what happen after that, fear comes in.
What If I fail to do it? My parents, My friends or co-workers may be disappointed and think of me as looser because they see I couldn't make it.

Once this kind of thought process settle in my life, life can easily get stuck, because like I said, there is always posibillity that I may fail, not because I'm not good enough, but mostly because I fear, stop me to act.

Then what should I do?

Well, first of all I have to confess that I still feel the same, but when fear comes in I started to think like this.

ah? you just came in right? stay right there for a while, until I sort out things for myself.

You may wonder how it's possible, right?

It's because I read the book called "You still don't know who you are".

In that book, writer speaks about many different things but one of the idea that came in my mind was about the perfectionism and Anxiety disorder.

In Korea, people admire the perfectionism, some of the high achiever says that I'm trying to be perfect at all time, and they share the amazing sotry of success because they have been perfect in some cases, and about the anxiety, people say anxiety as the feeling that should be removed, feeling that should be overcomed. 

But from my perspective, it's not that simple.

Like I said, people with high standard, open say to themselves that you should be better than this, and if you cannot meet this, you will fail.

But in reality, it's exactly the opposite, if you do it, you will at least become better version of yourself than doiong nothing. I'm not saying suddently, you become able to play piano or get 100 score more in exam, but at least you will get better than even with slight one inch than before whether you like it or not.

Almost every speech I had in Toastmasters meeting, I feel nervous and have butterfiy in my stomach. But does it mean, something wrong? 

YES I do fear on the stage and failure that I make,  YES I fear to let others down, if I am not keeping what I said I can do.

but NO, there is nothing wrong with me, because that's how things work in the world

12 years ago, I started my jorney of Toastmasters, I became officers, president, area director. I experienced collapse of Club which disappeared now and almost lost home club because of so many different circomstances around me.

But yet again, I'm here in this first club demo meeting for Dongtan Toastmasters.

Do you know my plan?

If I were 20 years ago, I may say I aim high, making perpect Toastmasters Club. 

but now I say I will try myself to be supportive at all time until we can charter the Dongtan Toastmasters and hoping that I will not regret because I will do my best. 

How about you?

Thank you back to Toastmasters
