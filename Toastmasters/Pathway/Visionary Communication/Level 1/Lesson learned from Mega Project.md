2021 December was the month when my part leader started asking to people if there is anyone who would like to join new project

At that time, I was working on Samsung Checkout for about 5 years, which is the payment solution on Samsung smart tv. So I thought, maybe 
this is time I need to do put myself out of the comfort zone and try something new.

and I also expected that maybe if I show to my part leader that I'm taking more work, it can be helpful for the promotion It was very simple reason.

If I briefly tell you about how gaming hub become gaming hub now.

At first, Service PM wanted gaming hub very much like the console game device without the actual console box.

So they wanted to allow user to be able to chat with friends with discord social app or to listen to the music while playing game on TV But of course, the latency
when playing cloud game was the 2nd priority because it's very much basic that can attact people to this service.

then what could be the top priority? any one can answer? yes, it's cloud game partner, if we just provide the cloud game which you don't even know who they are
then mostly likely people will not use it.

Ok, now it's about the situation

For the first 6 month, not even single cloud game partner was confirmed although we have already started preceding developement.
There were several up and down of contract with Xbox because of business deal during this time and until the 이원진 vice chairman visit the Microsoft to see
Xbox CEO face to face, nothing was certain.

So during this time, we only only develop the gaming hub but to make it working, we also made temporary partner app which exactly meet the gaming hub requirement.
it was like launching simple app and showing streaming game when it's launched but deeplink feature or server meta data integration kind of things was working properly.

situation didn't get better but went worse because, after about 4 month of of app development, VD TV home UX and their strategy of using it has been completely changed
that all we worked for 4 month needed to be discarded and we had to do the fresh start. For example at first it was independant app but later it become part home 
TV home category later.

If you have experiences you may know that how difficult it could be, to make new app even with same UI, if you have to use completely different framework.

like through away the android app and make similar ui app on IOS. 

We struggled because we didn't know how to use that new framework. But what can I do, after 
struggling on several month, we could make it anyway. Then performance issues came which was caused from this new framework, not because of our code.

I was frustrated, didn't know how to overcome the situation. Me and my SPM pay a visit the master (who is same as 상무님) Kim and having a vertical meeting to 
improve the tizen platform performance.

we had meeting almost every day.. engineers from kernel, system, application framework, uifw, home framework game home application, they discussed with 
very detailed log.

we did it for 2 month, but not so much improvement we could get. I was the host in that meeting like toastmaster and with master Kim in background, we updated
more than 100 packages to improve the performance.

3 preceding testing, 2 OTN process we went through in 1 and 6 months.

and Finally service launching was done in 2022 June 30.

I felt overwhelmed, exhausted, spent countless night barely sleeping because of worries (it's real!).

after 2 more weeks of service launching, I could get some time to look inside me and around me.

Why am I telling you about this? I think anyone in this company can fall into this kind of situation as long as they work in Samsung. So I think understanding the emotion you need to go through can help you to be more stable.

Do you know what's "the infinite game" means? this is one of the title of the book by author Simon Sinek who Love very much and I think I even delivered the speech
about it before.

Anyway, you have to understand the type of game you are in. What you are doing is just one of the project that has end, but in the end you are in the endless game of your life and you should maintain your strength until the end of your life.

so 1st thing you have to understand is that make sure that you don't get exhausted, if you do you will burn out and it means you are risking your life game. So take care of your mental and soul first, and health.

2nd, Sometimes in your life, you need to through yourself into the unkown situation. And if you think you need to do it, then please try to be with optimism. maybe you can find some person who is optimistic or you, yourself try to see things on bright side.

Because if you focus on the hard working or preoccupied with worries that might happen because of the situation, you can not move foward.

and last, take care of your self first and if you can, take care of the person next you because at the end of the day, what matter the most is human.


Thanks.
