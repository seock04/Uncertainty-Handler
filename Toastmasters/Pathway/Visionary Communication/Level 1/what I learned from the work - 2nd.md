when you work for the living, there are certain things you need to remember, whether it's big company or small company that you are working for or even when you are runing your own business.
Which means, if there is something that you do'nt just do it for a week, month or year and finish it but because you need to do more than 20, 30 years, you will be in similar situation at least one time 
and when you are in those situation, I hope, what I share today, could help you to prepare you self, emotionally and physically. 

I hope you can get a way with meaning of 3 keywords today, "The Infinite Game", knowing the type of the game you are in, "Positive", looking at the bright side and 
"Take care" of you and the person next you. 


2021 December was the month when my leader started asking to people if there is anyone who would like to join new project
At that time, I was working on same project for about 5 years, So I thought, maybe this is time I need to do put myself out of the comfort zone and try something new.
Before talk about what I learned, let me briefly tell you about how gaming hub become gaming hub now.
At first, Service PM wanted gaming hub, very much like the console game on TV without the actual HW attached. When it comes to the gaming experiences, there are a few very important factors, contents, latency(response performance) and the infra which we can say whether you can list to the music or chat with your friends while you are playing games or easily searchable game conntents.

What I was focused on was the 3rd one, the infra but Gaming hub itself was focusing on all of these. Then what could be the top priority? It's cloud game partner, if we just provide the cloud game which you don't even know who they are then mostly likely people will not use it.
although there has been the case when we did game service on TV before, this time was different because we had Xbox game pass, Stadia from google, Luna from Amazone etc. I can say that the game providers had big name which could surely attract gamers.

For the first 6 month, not even single cloud game partner was confirmed although we already started preceding developement. There were several up and down of contract with major partners because of business deal during this time and I was told that for one of the major partner, until the C level executive visited them to see their CEO face to face, nothing was certain with them.
So during this time, we not only develop the gaming hub but to make it working, we also made temporary partner app which exactly meet the gaming hub requirement. it was like launching simple app and showing streaming game when it's launched but deeplink feature or server meta data integration kind of things must work properly.

situation didn't get better after that, but went worse because, after about 4 month of of app development, VD TV home UX and their strategy of using it has been completely changed that all we worked for 4 month needed to be discarded and we had to do the fresh start. For example at first it was independant app but later it become part home TV home category later.
If you have experiences of making application, you may know that how difficult it could be, to make new app, even with same UI, if you have to use completely different framework. like through away the android app you already made and make similar ui app on IOS, especially if it's deeply integrated to the HW like TV it's even harder.

We struggled because we didn't know how to use that new framework for a while. But after struggling on several month, we could make it anyway. Then performance issues came out which was caused from not only because of the app but from this new framework and the platform itself.
I was frustrated, didn't know how to overcome the situation. Me and my SPM pay a visit the master, tech leader of VD SW and started vertical meeting to improve the tizen platform performance.

we had meeting almost every day.. engineers from kernel, system, application framework, uifw, home framework game home application, they discussed with very detailed log. we did it for 2 month, although we made big progress for the first boot performance, I was still worried until the end if it could be good enough to the user. I was the host in that meeting like toastmaster with master Kim on my shoulder (actually he did everything), we updated more than dozens of packages to improve the performance.
and Finally service launching was done in 2022 June 30.

I felt overwhelmed, exhausted, spent countless night barely sleeping because of worries (it's real!). after 2 more weeks of service launching, I could get some time to look inside me and around me.

Do you know what's "the infinite game" means? It's about understanding the type of game you are in. What you are doing is just one of the project that has end, but in the end you are in the endless game of your life and you should maintain your strength until the end of your life. so you have to understand is that make sure that you don't get exhausted completely, if you do, you will burn out and it means you are risking your life game. So I think taking care of your mind, soul, and health to maintain your life game is key to this. sometimes in your life, you need to through yourself into the unkown situation. And if you think you need to do it, then please try it with optimism. maybe you can find some person who is optimistic or you, yourself try to see things on bright side.
Because if you focus on the hard working and preoccupied with worries that may/may not happen in the future because of the situation, you can not move foward but stuck in a situation which will break you down. and last but not least,, take care of your self first and if you can, take care of the person next you because at the end of the day, what matter the most is the you and the people next you.

Thanks.
