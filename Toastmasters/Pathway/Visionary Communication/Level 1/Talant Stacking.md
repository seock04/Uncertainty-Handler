https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW2Kr0l2kGg


Do you make sufficient money for living? I think there are many different way to it but basically people make money by providing value to the people.

It's generally true but just providing value is not good enough but you have to be very good at what you do so that society or the market consider that your service or goods is very much valuable than any other people. 

I have no doubt that everyone in this room are very good at your work. Since you are hired by one of the top company in the world, it's obvious that you do have talent that provide value within the company.

Then you must be making good money with your talent, are you? (are you making decent money?)

If you are not satisfied with the money you are making now, I think you are very fortunate to be here today, because I will share the very good public secret that can bring you the money in the future.

This is from the Youtube channel called "Better than yesterday" and the title is Talent Stacking.

For a long time until now, I belived that people from the top of the pramid is taking most of the money, for example if you are the athlets, you know that most of the money which can be earned in your field will be taken by the gold medal list. right? I am sure the 1st and 4th will have big gap when it comes to making money.

How about the other profession? I think it's still true that mostly 10% from the top in their domain will take most of the money.

Then should I go to learn to become one of those top 10% in my domain? Considering that the competition in top 10% is brutal, sometimes it's more like time consuming because you don't even know if you can get to that level even if you try in the rest of your life.

The author of this channel suggest very interesting way of becoming top of the peramid.

He is saying that although you don't go through the extrem competetion in that level, there is a way to increase your market value exponentially more.

and it's even simple!

Here is the secret, Instead of trying to become world-class in one skill, what you need to do is you add another complimentary skill to your existing skill set.

That's it and the best part is you don't have to be extraordinary at that skill. Being good or just above average is often more than good enough.

He is saying that good + good is equal to or even greater than excellent. And more relavant skills you combine, the more valueable you can make yourself.

Actually this concept is not originally from this youtube channel but from the person called Scott Adams, the creater of the Dilbert comic strip. 

He is saying that he had average skill in art, humor and business but he found a way to combine all those into singular purpose (publishing comic) and thus he could create something that no one in the world can create.

How about you? as I said ealier in this speech, I'm sure you are good at one thing, your job description explains it well, but are you trying to learn complimentary skill now? if it's relavant to what you do it's even better. If not, I think you better think about what could be the next talent I need to stack for my career.

This is just a short introduction of concept of tanlent stacking, If you want to see the full version of the contents, just go to the youtube and search with Talent stacking or better than yesterday.

Thanks.
