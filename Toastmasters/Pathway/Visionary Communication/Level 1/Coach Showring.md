Did you know the exact meaning of coaching?

how about mentoring? or consulting? What is the differences between those?

Today, I want to share short story about why I'm thinking to start new journey of coaching.

But before we move on, let's solve the curiosity first.

ABC, what do you think is the difference between coaching and mentoring?

To understand it clearly, let me share exact definition of coaching first.

When you coach somebody, you belive that the person who is getting coaching does have infinite potential so that they can be anything they pursue 
and they are the one who knows the most about the issues or problem or goal they want to be or they have.

So, whatever they need, in coaching system, we believe that solution can be found by coachee themselves, coach just need to ask the right question for them.

and important thing in coaching Philosophy, it's not only coachee but the coach himself also has the infinite potential that they can ask right question as well 
so with right question and action plan they find together they believe that they can progressively approach to the goal they want.

but on the other hand, mentoring is a bit different, usually mentor gives advice from their experiences because most of the time, the person who do the mentoring 
has more experiences, it's same in consulting, if client has goal or issue, usually the consultant are the expert on that field and through out the process they setup
which they think is the best way for the solution, resolve the issue or reach to the goal because the consultant or mentor will provide 
best advice or solution to their client. Can you see the differences?

I felt coaching is more facinating because current world is changing so rapidly that sometimes there is no existing expert. Although, 
you want to find the person who can do counceling or consulting, it's very difficult to find who can provide the best solution because as time goes by, 
issue is changing, so as the solution in a short time. And sometimes even if there is a expert, the solution 
they think they maybe right for them, but we can never sure it can be applied to you as well, because the circomstance is different. 

So from my perspective, although the coaching philosopy seems a bit vague at first, but once they start, because coach and the coachee will progressively ask 
the right question and find the next step together to move foward step by step it can be the right approach in this fast changing world for almost every kind problems.

But how can I so sure if this is really the good one? yes, I do not know it yet, that's why I joined the program called coach showinging.

It was just short introduction session about how to become a real coach and what's the coach for about 4 hours including how to get a certificate of it.

I do not know if this can open new world for me or not, but in order to find out I decided to try it and see it by myself. 

so, I will be joining 20 hours class and 50 hours of practice to do coaching, which I will share the progress later in this meeting.

I hope you send me your support so that I can enjoy my new journey.

thanks.
