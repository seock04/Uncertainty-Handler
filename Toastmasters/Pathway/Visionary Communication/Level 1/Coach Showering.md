How are you? Are you feeling alright? 
Do you feel satisfied with current yourself?
Do you think you on the right track? if not let me help you.

Well, How do you feel when you are asked like this? 

About 8 month ago there was a person who asked me this kind of question, and I remember I was almost crying.

He called me in the middle of conversation with messenger and bought me meal in the very fency brunch restarant in 광교 and he intentionally let me sit on the table
where I can see lake view. It was sweat and I felt cared. I could also recognized that something was different because the way of conversation at that time was not like between the boss and the member.

A few month later I came back to his team after 1 and half year of task force activity. and soon I realized that he was coach in the company. 
and I was wondering what's the exact role of coach in the company.

and now already 3 month have passed since I came back, nothing was easy, but because I had some sort of trust with my boss, I didn't feel too much responsibility or burden. It's weird experience that how much I can feel relieved even with small change of mind and perspective. 

Come to think of it, I think it was because of good coaching he had for me.

It was the moment when I had my mind that one day I also want to help people in need like me, especially in this company, because I know how hard it could be 
and how much mental supporting is needed for those who feel exausted.

So, I asked him how can I become a coach and that's why he recommended me about coach showering. 

It may sound weird to you right? what kind of showering is this? 

Actually it was introduction session for about 4 hours regarding definition of coaching and the philosopy of coaching.

They tought me about how to join the class and what kind of certificate is there I can try.

Because I knew that I need KAC (Korea Associate Coach) certificate to become coach in the company, I also registered class for it as well.
It requires participation of 20 hours class and 50 hours of practice of coaching. long journey isn't it?

Today, let me just share the coaching philosopy that I learned from coach showering. I think it will gives glimps of what it is. 

1) WE(you as a coachee and I as coach) have unlimited potential for anything 
2) We do have good will to support you
3) The answer which you are seeking is within you

and one of my favorite thing about coaching is that coach does not give advice or solution for whatever the coachee is needed, they just ask the right question and support their action plan. This reflect the fact that coach have faith that you have the power to find the solution, it's you who knows the most about the problem, so it's inevitably you who could solve it. 

How do you think?

Well even now, I do not know if this can open new world for me, but in order to find out, I know that I need to try it and see it by myself. 
so my finaly comment for this speech is, please send me your support so that I can happily try my new journey, because I need it.

thanks.
