How are you? Are you feeling alright? <br>
Do you feel satisfied with current yourself?<br>
Do you think you're on the right track? If not, let me help you. <br>

Well, how do you feel when you are asked like this?

About 8 months ago, there was a person who asked me this kind of question, and I remember I was almost crying.

He called me in the middle of a messenger conversation and bought me a meal at the very fancy brunch restaurant in 광교, and he let me sit on the table on purpose
where I can see a lake view. It was sweat and I felt cared. I could also recognized that something was different because the way of conversation at that time was not like between the boss and the member.

A few month later I came back to his team after 1 and half year of task force activity. and soon I realized that he was a coach in the company. 
and I was wondering what the exact role of the coach is in the company.

and now already 3 month have passed since I came back, nothing was easy, but because I had some sort of trust with my boss, I didn't feel too much responsibility or burden. It's weird experience that how much I can feel relieved even with small change of mind and perspective. 

On second thought, I think it was because of the good coaching he provided for me.

It was the moment when I had it in my mind that one day I also want to help people in need like me, especially in this company, because I know how hard it could be 
and how much mental support is needed for those who feel exhausted.

So, I asked him how can I become a coach and  he suggested me about coach showering. 

It may sound weird to you, right? What kind of showering is this? 

Actually, it was an introduction session for about 4 hours regarding the definition of coaching and the philosophy of coaching.

They showed me how to enroll in the class and what types of certificates are available.

Because I knew that I needed a KAC (Korea Associate Coach) certificate to become a coach in the company, I also registered for it.
It requires participation in 20 hours of class and 50 hours of coaching practice. long journey, isn't it?

Today, let me just share the coaching philosophy that I learned from coach showering. I think it will give a glimpse of what it is. 

1) WE(you as a coachee and I as coach) have limitless potential
2) We do have good will to support you.
3) The answer that you are seeking is within you.

And one of my favorite things about coaching is that the coach does not give advice or solutions for whatever the coachee needs; they just ask the right question and support their action plan. This reflects the fact that coaches have faith that you have the power to find the solution; it's you who know the most about the problem, so it's inevitably you who could solve it. But if you find it difficult, I will be there for you, so let's try it together.

How do you think? Isn't it lovely?

We are living in a fast-changing world. It's so fast that sometimes, when you think you've become an expert in a certain domain, suddenly that knowledge becomes outdated and not needed anymore. So, even if you believe you can give advice or provide a solution based on your experiences, giving others advice can sometimes turn you into a "guru.(꼰데)".

They also told me various processes and the curriculum regarding coaching, but I think it's not important at this moment because I will get to know it. Then why am I telling you about this?

Well, to be honest with you, even now I do not know if this is the right one for me or whether it can make me better than yesterday, but in order to find out, I know that I need to try it and see by myself.

So my final comment for this speech is, "Please send me your support so that I can happily try my new journey, because I need it."

Will you?

thanks.
