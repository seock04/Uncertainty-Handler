2021 December was the day when my part leader started asking to people if there is anyone who would like to join new project

At that time, I was working on Samsung Checkout for about 5 years, which is the payment solution on Samsung smart tv. So I thought, maybe 
this is time I need to do put myself out of the comfort zone and try something new to grow.

That's why I joined the gaming hub project.

At first, Service PM wanted gaming hub very much like the console game device without the actual console box.

So they wanted to allow user to be able to chat with friends with discord social app or to listen to the music while playing cloud game.
And for the first 6 month, not even single cloud game partner was confirmed although we have already started preceding developement.

There were several up and down of contract with Xbox because of business deal during the firs 6 month and until the 이원진 부회장 visit the Microsoft to see
Xbox CEO, nothing was certain.

My circonstances was even worse because, after about 4 month of of app development, VD TV home UX and their strategy of using it has been completely changed
that all we worked for 4 month needed to be discarded and start fresh start. For example at first it was independant app but later it become part home 
TV home category later.


If you have experiences you may know that how difficult it could be, to make new app even with same UI, if you have to use completely different framework.

like through away the android app and make similar ui app on IOS. We struggled because we didn't know how to use that new framework. But what can I do, after 
struggling on several month, we could make it anyway. Then performance issues which caused from this new framework started to come.

I was frustrated, didn't know how to overcome the situation. Me and my SPM pay a visit the master (who is same as 상무님) Kim and having a vertical meeting to 
improve the tizen platform performance.

we had meeting almost every day.. engineers from kernel, system, application framework, uifw, home framework game home application, they discussed with 
very detailed log.

we did it for 2 month, but not so much improvement we could get. I was the host in that meeting like toastmaster and with master Kim in background, we updated
more than 100 packages to improve the performance.

3 preceding testing, 2 OTN process we went through in 1 and 6 months.

and Finally service launching was done in 2022 June 30.

I felt overwhelmed, exhausted, spent countless night without sleep.

2 more weeks of service launching, I was called and messaged for market issues and suddenly it become very quiet. and finally I could found inner peace from that time.

you see, something like ok it's done maybe :)
