One Step forward

The year of 2021, November 20th, I pass the Samsung SW certification Propessional level. Maybe it's easy task for someone, maybe it's something that need to go through
if they are SW engineers, but I personally wanted to talk about this unique experience in my 3rd Ice breaker because I learned not only about the knowledge or know how of algorithm but the emotion, thought or feeling that I had to go through when I felt overwhelmed by something I can not control was so specialy that It can explains one of my thought process  deep, deep inside of me.

First, it was 2016, June 18th, I pass the advanced level. Although I didn't think to work as SW enginner this long like 15 ~ 16 years when I first enter this company but I was so much relieved because I knew that I will not be kicked out from the SW development team at that time. It's funny isn't it?

But, as many of the SW developer know, it was just beginning and my struggling for this algorithm test continued 5 more years. I was distracted from it but doing more about the toastmasters or trying new certification exam which was very different from what I do in the company.

To tell you how much I was mentally not stable at that time, I was discussing about what to do for my life, in the meeting with my lab leader when he first join this 
company. I asked him whether I need to study something this company want me to do or something I think I need to do for the future which is different from what I do 
at work. 

His answer was funny and very simple, do both!, you know, I thought just in my mind that come on man, I do if I could do it.. useless.. something like that

but come to think of it now, maybe he was right. 

During this time, I was so much into 2 books 

And I remember that one of them was recommended by Dev, one of my best friends who I met in SOTM, I don't remember why he recommended clearly but I do remeber the title of it.

"The One Thing"

to make long story short, this boot was about what to do or how to act for to achieve something important in your life

It said, if there is something that can be the foundation of others that you need to do in the future or if it's the obstacle that must be resolved as condition to move toward the goal you wanted, do it first. Something like this.

I knew what it is.. after reading that book, because at that time I finished the course of Best Reviewer certificate as SW developer which took about 6 month to finish
but yet couldn't get it officially because I didn't have "profesional level certificate"

Next one was the "Grit: the power of passion and perseverance"
In this book, it said that it's not about the ability your are born with but it's passion and the perseverance toward the important long term goal you have to achieve.

which means, do not give up but continue to work on it until you can achieve it regardless of the time if it's important for you.

2021, I couldn't delay it more, because I knew that Samsung SW certification professional level is something always in my mind and it will drag my short term 
and long term goal and if I just give up, I thought that maybe I would never recover my self esteem as engineer.

so I started again, I was afraid because I failed many times in last 4 years and there is no guarentee that I can succeed this time.

I joined to the study group, first 4 month, I couldn't focus due to work and next 4 month, I was so much frustrated because 5 out 6 study group members already pass the 
test at that time so I had to study 1 on 1 with my mentor.

I gave up everything I did for fun, even the toastmaster's meeting. It was hard.

You know what, for this kind of exam, when there is only two result, success or failure, black or white, the desperation you feel when people who you thought "together" 
leave the boat one by one after they got what they need is enormous, and when you realized that finally, it's real that you are all alone in the boat because everyone else 
landed out to the next station, you can not get away from the doubt that can I really do it, am I able to do this.


During that time, I reminded my self with the saying what my mom use to say, "you are the person who does things as time goes by, in korean we say 대기만성형, 
so don't give up and don't think about others but focus on what you need to do, it's ok, you will do just fine". 


time passed, and the 2021, November 20th, I finally pass the test.

I didn't do it alone, there was a mentor who didn't give up and encouraged me until the end, the part leader who gave me a chance to study, and my dear family 
who endured this long long time with me at all times. 

It was difficult, but the fruit was so much sweat, I could recover my self esteem as SW engineer as well.

Ironically, although nothing about me as human changed, I could see so many chances ahead in my life and I could feel that I am getting more and more stablized mentally.
I even was surprized that I, myself was looking for the next goal.

2021, was bitter sweat to me.

I don't want to say I'm talented person, because there are people who easily pass it. But for those who are struggling in the pass to their goal, I just want to say this.

Don't give up, give it a try, remember you only need more time, never doubt on your ability, if I can do, you can do it.

Thanks.
