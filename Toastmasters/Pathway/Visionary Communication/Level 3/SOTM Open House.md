Hello everyone,
As many of you know, I've been involved with this club for quite some time now. Over the past few months, we've had some exciting developments that I'd like to share with you all.
Firstly, I am pleased to announce that our open house event was a great success. We were able to attract a diverse group of individuals who were interested in what our club has to offer, and as a result, we have added 17 new members to our club. This brings our total membership to 26, which is a fantastic achievement!
But attracting new members is only half the battle. Keeping them engaged and excited about being part of the club is equally important.
As you may know, our Toastmasters club offers a pathway education system that can be accessed online. However, we realized that some of our members were having difficulty understanding how to use the system and how to apply it to our offline club meetings.
To address this issue, I decided to take action and implement a mentoring program. / (Pause)
As the mentor for this program, I focused on helping members understand the role sheet, which is the time table for our weekly club meetings, and how to relate it to the pathway system. Through the coaching and group discussions, I shared my information on the subject and provided guidance on how to use the pathway system to enhance their learning experience.
I am proud to say that the mentoring program was a success, and our members now have a better understanding of how to use the pathway system and how to apply it to our club meetings. / (Pause)
In addition to the mentoring program, I also organized a social dinner event with eight members among the 17 new members we welcomed to our club. This event provided an opportunity for us to get to know each other on a personal level and build stronger connections within the club. I believe that building relationships and fostering a sense of community is just as important as developing our communication and leadership skills. / (Pause)
Moving forward, I aim to continue offering mentoring and coaching programs to our members. I understand that each member has their own unique goals and aspirations, and I want to help them achieve those goals within our club. Through one-on-one coaching sessions, I plan to work with each member to identify their specific target goal in Toastmasters, whether it's improving their English conversation ability, mastering meeting facilitation skills, or developing leadership qualities for leading an organization. Then, I will assist them in creating a customized action plan to move towards their final goal. / (Pause)
I firmly believe that investing in the personal and professional development of our members is crucial to the success and growth of our club. By offering tailored coaching and mentoring programs, we can ensure that every member has the opportunity to reach their full potential in Toastmasters.
So as we continue to support each other and grow together, our individual successes will ultimately lead to the success of our club as a whole. So, I encourage each and every one of you to take advantage of the resources and programs available to you in this club and to always keep striving towards your goals. And with that, I'd like to ask: what are your personal goals in Toastmasters, and how can we, as a club, support you in achieving them? Let's work together to make those aspirations a reality. / (Pause)
Thank you.

## Planning what to focus
##### Do what member wants!
 - Doing what people want is first (English? Public Speech? Leadership?)
 - Everyone has different Needs
 - Freedom is valuable, but learn by doing is what they came for.

##### Do it together!
 - Learn together
 - Talk together
 - Eat together

##### Build trusting team!
- Member should be able to feel...
  - there is something I can learn
  - there is something I can enjoy 
  - there are people I want to get together
  - I can do it in my real life

##### Make a system! 
 - Let them know what we have!
 - Let them know how to use it!
 - Let them plan and allow them to follow in advance


## Make an Action 
### Action 1 - 2023, 29th of March, Open house meeting of SOTM

Post on Knox Home

안녕하세요

Samsung One Toastmasters Club (이하 SOTM) 입니다.

영어로 대화하고, 영어로 발표하고, 영어로 회의 진행 하는게 필요하신 분들 계신가요?
아.. 그런거 까진 잘 모르겠고, 영어로 말하는 연습 상대와 환경이 필요하신 분들 계신가요?

매주 수요일 점심시간(12:00 ~ 13:00)에 진행하는 SOTM 미팅에 참여 하는걸 추천 드립니다.(수원사업장에서 합니다)

SOTM은 Toastmasters 의 Public Speech와 Leadership 시스템을 활용하여 성장하길 원하는 사람들의 모임입니다.

아.. 근데 누가 뭘 하는지 어떤 도움이 되는지 몰라서 망설여 지신다구요?

2023년 3월 29일 수요일 12시 수원사업장 센트럴파크 지하 1층 Art 9에서 SOTM 오픈하우스를 합니다.

아래와 같은 내용으로 오픈하우스가 준비 되어 있으니 참여하셔서 한번 알아 보시는 걸 추천드립니다.

참여 신청을 해 주시면, 오픈 하우스 이후에 저희가 관심있는 분들께 참여 방법을 가이드 드립니다.

 **Schedule of Talk Matters Season 4**

| Item | As Is | To Be |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Open House | * Goal 10 | * 41 people (including 1 VP) | 
| Official Members | * 8 Members <br> * Officers only| * 26 Members | 

** What's Next? ** 
 
### Action 2 - Build System
* More efficient system to prepare the meeting
* Need less people to prepare the meeting
* Everyone can participate and share their needs and feeling before and after the meeting

#### Mosaic Community, Messenger, Role Sheet (Thank you YTTM!!!!), and Mentoring
* Mosaic is like a blog, every notice, survey, even writing goes with it
* Use one Messenger and share the Agenda via online only (no printing)
* Share the "Role Sheet" in advance and motivate them to use it in advance... How??
* Start Mentoring system immediately!

### Action 3 Mentoring them all sincerely
* Let them understand how to use "Pathway" with "Role Sheet" to achieve what they came for

#### Important thing is "What they came for" FIRST!!!!!!

* Listen to their needs and explains how to use Toastmasters education system to fulfill their goal in Club

#### Admit that every single individual has different purpose of joing the club
* Some just want to learn how to speak in English
* A few aim to become good public speaker but in small scale (in English with no bigger than 10 people)
* A few aim to become fluent in conference leading, facilitating the meeting (in English, with small group)
* Very little, aim for leadership role (Club President, officers)

## Everyone has different purpose and they are all RIGHT!! 
 
### Action 4 Get to know each other
* Make social gathering 
* Talk to members more often
* Give Sincere feedback to their needs
* Motivate them for their next step!


## Understanding their needs should be FIRST! and arrange the others to meet their goal is next!
* DO not put club (nor Area, nor District) goal before member!!!!
* Member's goal should be the FIRST priority
* Toastmasters System is good?, no.. it's Great!!!, just I didn't use it in a proper way yet
* Learn by doing is not only for new member..
