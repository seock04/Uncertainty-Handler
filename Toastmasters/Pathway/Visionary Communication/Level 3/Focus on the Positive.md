When you are in a situation where everthing seems impossible, how do you react?
In my case I focus on what I can do and do one by one.

2023, February was the time when I felt something is seriously wrong in SOTM and that time, I didn't know what to do at first.
The number of active members were less then 5, we were barely filling out the roles, although we still had the meeting every week, It seems that not everyone in the club could enjoy the meeting anymore.

And, suddenly something bad happned, one of the officers decided step down and that was it, we were like crew who lost the captin.

If I share the emotion that I felt at that time, I felt helpless, lost and frustrated. 

If I stop there, maybe we wouldn't be here having this wonderful meeting now... so the story begins from there.

We had urgent meeting to see the situation, and shared thoughts with I thought still have will and love to this club. Youngman came back, Nare agreed to support.

What I did was listening to what peopl said, and I wrote them down and made a plan for the Open House. And as you know, the result was breath taking. Membership has grown from 8 members to 24. 

And you guys were so much fresh!

After the Open House, I still felt that I should not lose the focus, I felt that I have obligation to let you feel success and joy in growing. I tried to be positive. You may remember me saying, don't worry, It's all fine, no need to worry about.

Well.. do you think it's what I say to you? yes.. it is correct, but it's also the comment to my self, don't worry hoseock you are ok, we can figure out to make a good meeting.. something like that.

I remember SUN told us in his speech, that to have mind control, he tried to think like "It's nothing! It's ok to do in my way.." I could feel the emotion behind his speech. and when Jiyeon told about her ice breaking speech, I realized that there are so much I can learn from her life as well.
her kindness, positive thinking and proactiveness toward SOTM as well.

Now, it's almost 3 month after we had Open House, as promised, although we couldn't finish the mentoring yet, many of you guys have done your speech, and tried the roles in the meeting. You know what? if you ignore what I just said, I'm nobody. But because you all keep tried to the things that we talked and discussed.

You made me feel like leader of this club. I remember Sun told me that he can not imangine SOTM without me one day, I reall feel grateful to what he said and it all compensate to what I did so far.

Now, we are moving toward 2nd page, we will make new officer group of SOTM and sails to the new goal. During this journey, I will keep listen to you, get a feedback from you, and try to make your goal in this club reality.

With You.

Last week, in the meeting, Youngman said about the COT - Club Officer's Training, to tell you the truth, I didn't intend to go there because I know what I had to do, and considering the time and effort, I thought that it's better to me to use the time for something else.

But Youngman suggested me to share the story of success about the SOTM to the other club, because the district 93 is at stake. I assume that the other clubs, they also need to have more members for better meeting.

I'm a person who try to do important things first. To me, Members are the top priority including me, then the club, area ... and the District 93 is in last. I do belive that this kind of thought made current club status and if it's helpful, then I should share it to them.

So.. I changed my mind and try my best this chance of COT with club officers as an opportunity to step up further.

Well.. How do you see my story? I think in life anything can happen.. it can make you feel frustrated, lost and hopeless, but imporatant thing is, how you react, do you focus on positive? or cosider it as opportunity to grow? 
it's same in Toastmasters life, taking challenging role can be stressful, but if you change your mind to see it as opportunity to grow, focus more on the positive goal, I'm sure you will get more than you expected, just like what I experienced so far.

Members of Toastmasters, Toastmaster's journey is full of up and down, but doring this rollercoster, you will experiences many things, it can be positive and negative as well, but if you focus on positive and continue, one day, you will feel joy, accomplished and fullfilled, just like your life.

thank you for listening
