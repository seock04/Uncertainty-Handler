When you are in a situation where everything seems impossible, how do you react? In my case I focus on what I can do and do one by one. But before doing that, I should take some time to morn because those process make me feel exhausted normally and I kind of need time to be prepared for it.
2023, February was the time when I felt something is seriously wrong in my club and that time, I didn't know what to do at first. The number of active members were less than 5, we were barely filling out the roles, although we still had the meeting almost every week, It seems that not everyone in the club could enjoy the meeting anymore.
And, suddenly something bad happened, one of the officers decided step down and that was it, we were like crew who lost the captain.
Sharing the emotion that I felt at that time, I felt helpless, lost and frustrated.
If I stop there, maybe we wouldn't be here having this wonderful meeting now... so the story begun from there.
We had urgent meeting to see the situation, and shared thoughts with people, who I thought still have the will and love to this club. Youngman came back, Nare agreed to support.
What I did was listening to what people said, and I wrote them down and made a plan for the Open House. And as you know, the result was breath taking. 
Membership has grown from 8 members to 24.
And you guys were so much fresh! Something amazing happened, I felt blessed.
After the Open House, I still had doubt so I thought I should not lose the focus, I felt that I have obligation to let you feel success and joy in this club. I tried to be positive. You may remember me saying, don't worry, It's all fine, no need to worry about.
Well.. do you think it's what I say to you? yes.. it is correct, but at the same time it’s like spell from the 해리포터 to myself, don't worry hoseock you are ok, we can figure out to make a good meeting.. something like that.
I remember one day Sun told us in his speech, that to have mind control, he tried to think like "It's nothing! It's ok to do in my way.." I could feel the emotion behind his speech. and when Jiyeon told about her ice breaking speech, I realized that there are so much I can learn from her life as well. her kindness, positive thinking and pro activeness toward SOTM as well.
Now, it's almost 3 month after we had Open House, as promised, although we couldn't finish the mentoring yet, many of you guys have done your speech, and tried the many roles in the meeting. You know what? if you ignore what I just said, I'm nobody. But because you all keep tried the things that we talked and discussed.
You made me feel like leader of this club. I remember Sun told me that he cannot imagine SOTM without me one day, I really feel grateful to what he said and it all compensate to what I did so far.
Now, we are moving toward 2nd page, we will make new officer group of SOTM and sails to the new goal. During this journey, I will keep listen to you, get a feedback from you, and try to make your goal in this club reality with you.
Last week, in the meeting, Youngman said about the COT - Club Officer's Training, to tell you the truth, I didn't intend to go there because I know what I had to do, and considering the time and effort, I thought that it's better to me to use the time for something else.
But Youngman suggested me to share the story of success about the SOTM to the other club, because the district 93 is at stake. I assume that the other clubs, they also need to have more members for better meeting. Personally I know how important this community and I become emotional.
I'm a person who try to do important things first. To me, Members are the top priority including me, then the club, area ... and the District 93 is in last. I do believe that this kind of thought made current club status and if it's helpful, then I should share it to them right?.
So.. I changed my mind and do the things that are more meaningful in Toastmasters community.
In life anything can happen.. it can make you feel frustrated, lost and helpless like a roller coaster, but important thing is, how you react, where do you focus on.
Find the signal, signal of positive side, Can you feel that? I’m sending you it now. Let’s have wonderful 2nd page together.

Thanks.
