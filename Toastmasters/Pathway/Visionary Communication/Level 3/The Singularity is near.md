Singularity is near

It's been more than 3 years since I get to know this book, but at that time, I couldn't agree to the point that singularity might happen around 2050.
and I didn't think that human can not control the AI or machine like it was described in that book.

But now in 2023, when I see the "what's happening in the world", It seems that maybe it's real and it maybe coming right at us even before 2050.

To make my speech more reliable, I will summon 2 of the most famous person in the world and share what they talk about AI.

1st is Yuval harai who wrote the book "Sapiens" and he is strongly warrning hamanity regarding AI
and the 2nd one is a Kevin Kelly, long time journalist as well as the author who was the invited speaker about the AI in my favorite podcast called "People I mostly admore"

In the movie of terminator, AI was described as ultimate machine that has physical body and try to destroy the humaninty, and in the movie of Matrix, AI is like a virus in the internet which can destroy the cyber being of human who swallowed blue pill to be connected to that world.

But what about now? is AI something like terminator or Matrix? well Yuval harari is saying no to both. He is saying that current AI is using the interface which humans have been using only between them until.

To understand what it means, we need to look back how Human have survived on earth as a dominant species. but luckly he is expert on that. He starts to talk about the operating system of  man kind first.

What is the OS - operating system of real world? as you may know OS for PC is window or Mac and OS for mobile we use android or IOS. 
but for the real world where human live, what is the operating system? I think many people have different Idea but Yuval said it's the Story

For you to undesrtand better, Humans have various different story, for example, we use money which is nothing in actual world. We can not eat or wear, or use to prtect but with the story behind it, we use to exchange food, shelters, cloth. 
how about the "Human Right" which is also nothing but human made up of story for themselves to differenciate the human being from other animals. So that we are something above the other animals on the planet.

Until today, there has been no threat to human or with colaboration of humans based on the story, we could depeat and being the dominant species on earth now. But he think situation is changed now due to AI.

He even say that democracy will be destroyed by AI if we do not regulate them to how we want. He describe that current AI is making up the story just like human, 24 hours and anywhere in the world at the same time but the problem is.
They put some lie between the truth without revealing who they really are and human will not be able to control it. 
He sees this same as fake paper bill like money that are considered as criminal(if you use..) because democracy has been built on the story by trustable people. But now we can not distinguish the story whether it's by real human or not anymore.

So although it's very early stage of AI, AI is already making decision for human, and if we lose control which we are already losing it in many cases, what will happen 10 or 20 years later?

I hope you are not so much scared by what I shared, let's see some bright side as well.

This is what Kevin Kely said, when we look back the history of human, technology that were like erupting volcano was showing something very common, and it happened when the human like interface arose.

Let's jump in to the world where there is no Graphic User Interface for the computer, it was still the computer but peopl had to use command line to order computer to do something, until that time although computer itself had capacity of doing what it was doing, only a handful of people used it 
but because of the GUI that are more friendly to communicate with computer, it suddently become amazing tools to use. and Kevin Kelly is seeing AI from the same perspective, AI's capacity has been growing for more than decades and it's potential was already there, but suddently
people realized that this tool is not just for a few frontier but for everyone as long as they can use conventional human language. 
and if we can ride the time machine to go back to where the first computer was invented and say about that we do now in 2023, although it's only 20 or 30 years ago, people from that time may not not believe what's happening now and he sees AI the same.

and the other aspect we should consider is..

Because AI is like an electricity, it will enpower every espect of the technology, for example, AI doctor, we know that AI doctor is not as good as Human doctor, but a human plus AI doctor is better than either human alone or AI alone. and that AI doctor alone is although its not as good as human doctor,
is million times better than no doctor.  Think about the future of africa where people do not have access to doctor even now? 
and we have to see AI as plural form, not singular. We will make hunderes thousands of different version of AI. It's already happening in so many places. And they are all co working with human to break the boundary of their field to move forward.
he also said that current version of AI has been trained on average of human creation, so what you are getting is basically the idea of average human can think of which from our perspective have a lot of room to improve. 

So, like he said earlier, this is not as complicated as it may seem now after a while.

But, these there is one thing in common that these 2 people are saying and it's about the regulation and the process of losing control of AI.

like I said earlier releasing new AI to the public without regulation is like leting the new species to the public without what it can do to us. So we should know what it is first and to do that, we should be able to undestand why AI is making a decision in that way.

As you know AI has been trained from the blackbox, so even the AI trainer does not know why they are making those decision, they say AI said after they got milions of milions of data. But we need to understand why for the future.


If I add my opinions to those 2 very famious people's opinion, important thing is various different version of AI from the different country for different purpose with different data will make AI more like organic being in the future. Maybe we will see the combination of those cases where AI being a threat and hope to us
and at the same time for a few people who does not have the average knowledge human being maybe living by the guidance of AI. 

And think about your next next generation who raise their children with AI but to protect and raise them and work at the company at the same time, they might leave their child more and more with AI.
but if they feel more attached to the AI more than their parents? what will happen? do you think it's impossible? see some of the otaku in the world who are already in love with 2D characters, we never know the future.

Is there any breakthrough? or should we just wait and see?

the common answer from experts to this is try to expand and develop the potential and the capacity of human being while we are trying to develop the potential of AI.

like kelly mentioning that 10,000 years from now is not something we can easily imagine but looking back, we should belive that the generation of human have done the great job of making solid future for us and maybe we should do the same, 
and like Yuval said oviously change is coming and if we are divided and not cooperate for the future to future of humanity can be in danger but if we cooperate and improve the potential of human itself we can be fine.

Singularity is really near now, what are you going to do with AI? if you haven't thought about it yet, I think maybe now is the time to think about it
