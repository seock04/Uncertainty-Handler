If you ask me what was the most significant achievement I ever had in last 10 years, I would say, It's experiences that I had from Toastmasters Club.

While I was in there, I've learned skills for the public speech just like now, leadership skills to run small organization like Toastmasters Club 
and how to communicate with people to achieve what I wanted.

It also gave me the confidence in English so now I'm not afraid of doing anything in English, even for the professional level.

A few years ago, while I was doing my pathway project, I made catch phrase for my life like "Uncertainty Handler".

World is becoming more and more uncertain that I as a human, l wish to become the person who is not afraid of uncertainty but willing to put myself in the center of it
to over come and help other people to live happily.

Amazingly, although I was so much afraid of my professional career, I could pass the hectic exam for the SW engineer and even become the principal something in the club.

which is amazing because when I look back, I still remember that I thought I might work as SW engineer around 3 years when I first join this company
but it's been already more than 17 years now.

If I have to choose one thing about the value of the toastmasters, it's not about leadership or communication skills. 

It's about being aware of my self more clearly and try to find the way to get over the whatever obstacle I have in front of me, where and how did I learn it?

I saved club 2 times, one from GSTM which was in Gumi Smart City campus Toastmaster Club, and the other from Samsung One Toastmasters Club.
I pass the SW certification test after 5 years of trial by confessing it and confronting in speech and even getting help with toastmaster members
which was one of the major reason that I could become principal engineer. 
I could become certified Coach by the help of two 마루타 from club and now I even make my vision with pathway project. I can see one of that 마루타 there. 

Thank you Youngman.

What I want to say is this, I love Toastmaster, but more than that, I love the people in this club because thats the value of this community.

I want each and every one of you can have own way of success in this club because I know what I experenced will not be same as yours, but whatever you experience
from here, if you open yourself to it and embraces the challenge with joy, you will feel happy not the same kind of happy that I had, but best version of your own happiness.

You remember I told you I almost lost my club 2 times but I got so much insight from that experiences now. 
This club may seem like small world, but you can experience and experiment anything you wish for so.. 

My vision is to build basecamp for the members of toastmaters so that they can setup vision with action plan and experiment it. 

and for your information, it's already started.

Thanks.
