## Proof of Concept for the bigger world

<br>
Have you ever heard of the word, POC before? This is a kind of jargon that we use in the engineering world when there is something that we think good, but not sure if it's really working in the real world, we try to make it to see if it's really working as we expected.
In my life, it's full of POC, first, in order to understand the feeling of "being 1st means everything", I joined high school basketball team and until I graduate the university, I competed in game so many time to get the championship. Although it's not like national basketball team or NBA, It was still very sweat to win the competition.
But I realized after around 10 years of trial that winning is not everything in my life, it feels good for very short period of the time but somehow I'm not that kind of person who likes to win over other people.
next, I applied Engineering University even after I graduated from 문과, ‘liberal arts’ from high school. It was really full of surprise and until now, but at that time I had to keep really good relationship with my professor when I was in the first grade because I was so bad in Mathematics for my grade and after I got a job in Samsung because of those algorithm knowledge based on Math, I was under very deep dark tunnel for about 5 years until I pass the SW certificate Exam for professional level.
I also did quite many POC in Toastmasters, I tried to engage with local University in order to keep the sufficient member counts when I was the president of Gumi Smart City Toastmasters Club and being President of SOTM for the first time around 6 years ago was also kind of proof of concept for me like if I do things like this and that, will it be good enough for the club, something like that.
To tell you to truth, the open house that I had early this year with you was the POC as well. It turns out as jackpot, one of the biggest success in my life, and trying to be a coach was also one of them.
And.. My latest POC is based on the knowledge I learnt from Coaching.
Some people say that they are not sure if they are living the life or they are being lived by the life. This kind of feeling comes when you have no plan but very busy with your life.
Imagine, you spend hack of day and right before you fall into sleep, you just realized that none of the thing that you did today, was for your happiness.
Have you ever felt like this?
People say that it's important to follow your mind, do what you love! Have you heard about that? Even if I know what I love, I sometimes lose control of my life because of time, relationship, and the motivation.
And for that we use Nudge, because Nudge will give you the power to move yourself to the goal you wish to reach with your free will. 
Nudge is something that are external environment that help you navigate to the ideal place by boosting your action toward it. 
Some of you remember the survey I did with Toastmasters member, those are the main 4 questions.
===================================
1)	What is your primary goal in Toastmasters Journey?
2)	To make your plan aligned to your primary goal, where do you want to focus in coming 6 month?
3)	How do you imagine yourself after 6 Month? (please describe yourself when you successfully accomplish your plan)
4)	Did you make your action plan to achieve your goal? (your action plan need to be reflected to the Role Sheet excel for SOTM) 
===================================
It's about what's your goal and how do you want to achieve it. Let’s make plan. Can you see what's Nudge in here?
Its action plan in 4th. Do you know the difference between behavior and Action? Behavior does not have intention but Action does, that's why we call Action Plan, not behavior plan.
Anyway, if you followed this survey properly, your plan should be reflected to the Role Sheet, what it does is.. it will change the your default action of meeting participation to Yes instead of No.
So.. it will help you achieve your goal by helping you "not to think too much about whether you will come to practice your speech or not" but just come and do. External environment but help you move toward your goal. Does it make sense?
We've had 11 people so far who attended for this program, and after around a few months we will see how those people will feel about themselves.
From club president's perspective, they helped to prepare the club meeting in advanced, from Coach's perspective this will tell me that, was it really helpful? so that I can use this concept again in the future. And you as participants? You will see how powerful it is if you live your life as you intended.

We haven't seen the result yet, so I cannot guarantee anything.. but I'm very curious about the result of those who participated well after 6 month.
Do you remember what I did as PoC in life? How do you think? like my life, your life can be also full of trial, if you try something just out of your comfort zone, you may feel afraid or hesitant, even stressed, but don't you want to check it if you have those potential? 
Have curiosity, it doesn't matter whether you accomplish it or not, because at the end of the day, you will take one step toward your ideal self.
ah~ by the way, if you also want to give it a try, just write down your answer to this question and share it to me and reflect your action plan to the role sheet, and live your life as you planned, let's see what's going to be changed, because we have nothing to lose right?

Thanks.
