When I first started my coaching journey, I was told to start SNS to have client.

But the problem is, I'm not the SNS kind of guy, I only write an article when it's necessary.. such as preparing for speech or to maintain the history of what I do.
So, I couldn't do it at first.

But later while I was learning and coaching people, I realized that I should write down what I learned, because if I just move on without making note of what I do, the impact and the speed of growth can be slower than I expected.

So I decided to write down the lesson I learned from Book, Youtube, Podcast, even from activity that I was doing for Toastmasters and SOTM.

The naver blog that I introduced is the one that I created for my Coaching journey, so the first post of this blog is with my KAC certification and after that, I posted several writing about Toastmaster activity as well as about the books that I read.

In this Blog, I introduced my self as C Coach, who help clients to See their innerself and Embrace the Change so that they can challenge to their comfort zone.

So, I wrote them all on the header of this blogger because I wanted to show my identity as Coach.

I also used posting to communicate with my wife, in coaching world there is term called "Self Coaching", It means Coach do the coaching for themselves. It's funny right? but when I found that something that I thought it's good to share with my wife, I posted and shared a link to her.

She loved it. The relationship between me and wife become better now because of this Coaching blog. 

Sometimes I share the youtube video, podcast, article from the internet to my client because it's relavant to the situation they are in so it might be good information for them.
and when I do that, I will share via this blog so that my future client who likes my contents can refer to it easily.

I have a dream, one day, I can be recognized as a life coach who can be visited to discuss any issue by members within my community. I know it will not be possible in the near future but as long as I continue the studying and coaching people, with this blog, I'm sure I can be needed coach for the people (I hope)

Haha

Thanks
