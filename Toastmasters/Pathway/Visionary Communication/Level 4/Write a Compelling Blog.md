Do you know the important value of person who has the high self-esteem?

Unlike ordinary people, they see themselves very objectively that they know what they are good at and what they need to improve

This is very important when it comes to the personal growth. We usually talk to the people that if we experiences the small success in a daily life, we become confident as time goes by and it will give the strenth and make ourself with high self-esteem.

But, in here there is something that we should understand.. this small success should be out of our comfort zone if we want to grow further.

If you try things that you are already familier then probably the small success that you tied does not make much effect on your confidence. 

just 10% out of your comfort zone, every time. Then, it's the real growing. You may wonder why I'm talking about it here. 

For me, writing blog was something that were out of my comfortzone, to tell you the truth, I'm not the SNS kind of guy so I didn't even think of writing blog as a method to communicate with people online.

But later while I was learning and coaching people, I actuall needed to write down what I learned, because if I just move on without making note, the impact and the speed of growth was slower than I expected.

So, from that perspective, I was looking for the online space which I could not only save my learning experience, but sharing and communicating with other people

The naver blog is the one that I created for my Coaching journey, the first post of this blog was with my KAC certification and after that, I posted several writing about Toastmaster activity as well as about the books review.

In this Blog, I introduced my self as C Coach, who help clients to See their innerself and Embrace the Change so that they can challenge to their comfort zone.

I wrote them all on the header of this blogger because I wanted to show my identity as Coach.

I also used posting to communicate with my wife, in coaching world there is term called "Self Coaching", so when I found something that's good, I posted and shared a link to her. She loved it. I almost feel that the relationship between me and wife become better now because of this Coaching blog.

Sometimes I share the youtube video, podcast, article from the internet to my client because it's relavant to the situation they are in so it might be good information for them. but from now, when I do that, I will share via this blog so that my future client who likes my contents can refer to it easily.

I have a dream, one day, I can be recognized as a life coach who can be visited to discuss any issue by members within my community. 

I know it will not be easy but as long as I continue the studying and coaching people sincerly, with this blog, because they see what I been through in my coaching journey, It can be possible right?

Thanks
