Do you know the story of pink king? Once upon a time, there was a King who loved the color of pink. He loved pink so much, that he asked to his servant to paint everything around him to pink. 
They could paint almost everything to pink but there was one thing that none of them could paint... and it was... sky.. 
So the King was very upset because he even wanted sky to be pink but it was not possible, one day, old man came to his king and put the pink glasses to him, then suddenly everything was changed to pink even the sky.
How do you think? Do you have any experience like this? Things that you never thought possible is actually possible within a flash of time
Last 17 years, I have been living as a person who solve the problem, because I'm an engineer, solving problem has been my life. Every time I face the difficult situation, I tried to solve it, mostly it worked, but not everything.
I didn't know why, but keep searching for why..
Last year, I met "Coaching" and it changed one thing in my life but it was very big ONE thing. 
There is a quote in coaching world... "Don't try to solve the problem of your client, but try to coach them." Do you know what my first reaction to this was? "What the hell?" But I know the meaning now. It means, your client will find a way, in other words, they will solve the problem, as long as you take care of your client properly.
Suddenly it said, I should not focus on problem solving, which I am very good at, and have experiences of more than 17 years. But focus on the person, their feeling, and their needs and try to understand them truly. Because, if I do, then they will solve the problem in their life by themselves
Coaching also asked me to help expand my client's point of view, let them see things from different perspective before they make decisions, and help them understand and communicate with their inner self. Because, if I do, then they will start making better choice and perform better for their goal.
Well... Do you think I believed from the beginning? Hell no… I had doubt... until I saw it works.
I can't say it's all because of experiences in SOTM but my doubt was changed to faith because you guys showed me that it works.
That's why I introduce "Better than yesterday coaching program" to you. Because I wear the coach's glasses now. If I just treat you properly as coach, you guys will solve the problem, running the club meeting properly. I want to see it, that’s the purpose of what I am announcing now.
"Pathway Level Hunter & Role Masters" is one thing I came up for SOTM members after mentorship for new members are nearly ended.
For your information, Pathway is education system that Toastmasters provide and some of you know that there are 5 levels in on path. So Pathway level hunter means, participants will learn more about the pathway by doing the project under the coach's supervision and they will achieve the levels. And I’m sure once they reach to the point where they complete the each level, they people will notice the changes.
Role Masters are a bit different, until now how many roles have you tried in the meeting? What was the most difficult one? Did you feel you could do it better if someone besides you tell you how you can improve it? If that's your case, you can apply for it because your coach will support you until you master that role.
We will hunt to achieve Pathway level and master the roles that you think you need to improve.
I will provide 1on1 coaching session to all the participants 1 time per month and discussing what your goal is and how we should proceed to accomplish them.
While you are doing it, you will set your goal and share constructive feedback to each other’s.
I know I cannot guarantee the result, but one thing I can assure you is that you will not feel alone because we will be there together with you.
And when we see small success, we will be happy for you and we will celebrate together with you.
How do you think? I hope it make senses to you. Because after this meeting when it's ready, I will share the link for the apply, this project will continue up to 3 months, and additional effort will be required, so please take your time and think about it.
Thanks
