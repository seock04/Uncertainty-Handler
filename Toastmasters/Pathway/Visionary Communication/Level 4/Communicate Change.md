Do you know the story of pink king? once upon a time, there was a King who loved the color of pink. He loved pink so much, that he asked to his servant to paint everything to pink.
You know what, they could paint everything to pink but there was onething that non of them could paint... and it was... sky..
and maybe some of you know that answer, one of wise servant came to his king and put the pink glasses then suddenly everything was changed to pink even the sky.
How do you think? Do you agree that wise servant is really wise?

Last 17 years, I have been living as a person who solve the problem.
Every time I face the difficult situation, I tried to solve it, mostly it worked, but not everything. 

I didn't know why, but keep searching for why..

Last year, I met "Coaching" and it changed one thing but very big ONE thing.

There is a quote in Coaching world...
"Don't try to solve the problem of your client, but try to coach them."
Can you guess what it means?

Suddently it said, I should not focus on problem solving, which I am very good at, and have experiences of more than 17 years. But focus on the person, their feeling, their needs and try to understand them.

Coaching also asked me to help expand my people's point of view, let them see things from different perspective before they make decisions, and help them understand and communicate with them selves inside them.

I had doubt... until I saw it works, my doubt was changed to faith now because you guys showed me that it works.

That's why I introduce new growth coaching program to you.

"Pathway Level Hunter & Role Masters" is onething I came up for SOTM members after mentorship for new members.

We will hunt to achieve Pathway level together and master the roles that you think you need to improve together.

we will review the project together and record video and share the feedback together.

I will provide 1on1 coaching session to all the participants and discuss what's your goal and how we should proceed to accomplish them. 

While you are doing it, you will set your goal and share constructive feedback to each others under the supervision of my coaching.

And also you guys will do speeches and take roles that you think you need to improve more.

Last week, I got 3 amazing advisers, they will provide me real feedback of what's really needed and what's better for the people.
And I will try my best to serve clients as Growth Coach.

I know I can not guaranntee the result, but One thing I can assure you is that you will not feeling alone because we will be there together with you.

And when we see small success, we will be happy for you and we will celebrate together with you.

This new change will bring a few things to the club, 1st, participants will fill out the speech slot and roles, because they will learn by doing.
SOTM members will see their progress clearly and will not struggle alone because we will all there together.

How do you think? will you join?

Thanks
