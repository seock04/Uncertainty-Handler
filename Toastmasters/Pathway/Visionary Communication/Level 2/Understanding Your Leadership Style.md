## Coaching in Leadership

Today, I want to talk about 2 things, one is about what I learned with my leadership style in this project for the current version of me, and the second is what kind of leadership style I'm pursueing these day.

I tested myself with the leadership style in this project, and the result is...
top most 2 were.. Democratic and Coaching (actually I had same point for Affiliative but I think it's ok to say like this)

How do you think? Does it make sense, I mean, since you guys have experienced me for more than couple of years, do you agree on it? 

personally, I think it's mostly right, because those are the easiest leadership style I can think of and I feel comfortable when I'm working like that.

Although I reminded myself what kind of leadership style I have, I don't think that's all, understanding my leadership style can give me what I'm good at and not good at but the point is.. "are you flexible with it". Can I switch my leadership style which can make most out of the circomstances?

some people might say, authoritative/Bureaucratic leadership may not be good because it's hirachecal, and it's not following the trend. 

but understanding the benefits and disadvantage of those style is still important and in a certain context, you may see it's more efficient, so becoming a leader who understand their version of leadership style and being able to switch it to the more suitable one is the key becaus we never know what will happen in the future right?

and the second story is about the recent ah ha moment that I want to share with you

let me ask you a question first, "if your friend who is using 300 million won keyboard, said that I want to change my keyboard now I feel pain on my neck and sholders with it I don't think it's right for me".

what would you say to him? 

when he came to you, he acted like this (목과 어깨를 감싸며 옴)

You know he is not liying, but it's also true that his keyboard is one of the best keyboard in the world.

if we hear the story until here, some of you may say, what on earth are you talking about, you stopid, go to clinic, do not waste your money on your keyboard, you already have the good one man!

am I right? 

well, to tell you the truth, I am this friend, haha

my point is this, I actually had constant pain on my neck and right shoulder, and because my keyboard type had 10 key with numbers, it was too long which resulted me with bad body posture, like this, so after about 5~6 months my pain has grown bigger and bigger and bigger.

the funny thing is, I went to 한의원, 물리치료실, hospitals literally every place but it was only for a day that I could ease the pain but it didn't last longer.
but once I changed my keyboard, just after a few days, my pain went a way. funny isn't it?

The lesson I've learned is this..

What I say in conversation may tell you the truth but maybe it's not what really I need, usually what people say is fact, we think fact is the most important thing, however, it's actually just tip of the iceberg, so if you are the leader, you need to practice to see the emotion and read the context underneath the fact, so while having conversation like this you could find the real needs.

and maybe not all of you because some of you already have those experiences, for those who thought, it's ridiculous to connect neck pain with keyboard, but I think it's same with different situation as well, try not to judge the words or phrases that they say, but talk to them with good will, instead of judging inside your head but have curiosty toward the person you are dealing with, then you will find the real needs.

I'm not saying that you have to be like this all day, but just try when you think you are in leader's position. Don't think you can be like this in a one day, you need to do the practice.

But if you consistantly try.. then you will be an good leader one day. How do I know? you know I'm learning how to coach, I even started practice.. :) and at the same time.. I believe that all of you have potential to be a good leader.

Thanks.
