What do you do when you are stuck to somewhere you and whoever the person you talk with can not narrow down the point to agree?

I think it's the time when you profoundly need to check if you are listening well.

Then what is profound listening? 

Let's imagine that you and your friend are sitting on a couch and you are talking something and your friend is responding like ye~ ye~ like this.
and suddenly you noticed that you are not listend, then you said, Are you listening? but your friend respond like "of course~ you just said, this and that... " exactly what you said..

do you think he listen to you in this case? I do not think so..

I can say that you hear the words and sounds because you could repeat what you just heard, but it doesn't mean that you properly listen to somebody.

When you say I listen to you, it's not only understanding the sequence of words but the true meaning underneeth of it.

Fact / Emotion / Needs

If you are the sensitive person then you might remember that I used these 3 words before in my speech, but any let's remind what it is.. 

Especially, if you are listening to someone and just listen to the fact, it's not easy to agree always, because maybe you think what other person is saying is not right or opposite to your view.

But what's the meaning of understanding emotion?
