Do you have experience when you feel stuck? You are in a situation where you have to get all the agreement the others but it seems it's impossible to get agreement from all side, what should we do? give up?

I think it's the time when you need to check if you are listening well.

Then what is profound listening? 

Let's imagine that you and your friend are sitting on a couch and you are talking something and your friend is responding like ye~ ye~ like this.
and suddenly you noticed that you are not listend, then you said, Are you listening? but your friend respond like "of course~ you just said, this and that... " exactly what you said..

do you think he actually listen to you in this case? 

I can say that you hear the words and sounds because you could repeat what you just heard, but it doesn't mean that you properly listen to somebody.

When you say I listen to you, it's not only understanding the sequence of words but the true meaning underneeth of it.

Fact / Emotion / Needs

If you are the sensitive person then you might remember that I used these 3 words before in my speech, but anyway, let me tell you about it again

If you are listening to someone and just listen to the fact, it's not easy to agree always, because maybe you think what other person is saying is not right or opposite to your view.

But what's the meaning of understanding emotion? 

Let's say you had fight, and the person who you fought is now very depressed and she even want to die.. really! but still in your deep mind, you know that you are right, not her.

In this case, if you only consider the fact, you will never be able to fill the gab. But If you look at the emotional side, it's abit different story.

You have seen that person, suffering from the fact, but I know I still can not agree with you, but because I know you suffered a lot, I understand how painful you feel now about it, you can acknowledge that somehow she suffered enough. Do I have to hate her anymore? is it still worth to have emotion like this? 

and finally next step is understanding the real needs.

Despite the fact that she still have the thought or mind that are completely against me, I understand her emotion behind it with whatever reason, she also does not feel great, actually she feels awful because of it. 

when it comes to this stage, fact doesn't matter, because it does not mean much to both side. That's why people forgive others sometimes or they just keep distance so that they do not cross the line.. which is ok to live together in the same society.

I think this is the power of profound listening.

Make yourself to survive in uncomfortable converstation and give another chance to alter your approach. I'm not only talking about the fight but this profound listening can help you understand real story of others that sometimes it save you from falling into wrong direction.

As a coach or as a leader, we all need to be a good listener because we live in a society where we should know the real needs of others. So to be the right leader, I think it's essential to train yourself to be a profound listener.

Thanks
