When it comes to the success of life, many people say that having mentor is one of the good way. Although, the form of mentor can be real person 
or a book or maybe the person in the history, but I think having kind of mentor who can guide me and teach me the good way is very critical.

Despite the fact that it's too early to talk about sucess of my life, I think it's ok to tell you that there has been a few people who influenced my life.

First one was the senior studuent who helped me to improve English when I was 20 something years old. 

At that time I think the timing was perfect because I had quite much time and he wanted people to get together so we were meeting every week regulaly 
in group and having fun for more than a year. We used English Conversation book to talk more than an hour, 3 times every week. 
During this time my Toeic score jumped up from 600 something to 860. Not to mention that I used those score in many applications for other opportunities, 
I could get confidence in my English ability which was the base of my life now. And as far as I remember, my last Toiec score was 940 and then I stopped
taking exam. 

and Second one was Fred who used to help me as mentor for SW certificate, as many of you know, although I'm SW engineer, I struggled for more than 5 years
to get professional level certificate in Samsung and it was very painful, however, because of the mentoring by Fred. I was able to get it and it helped me
in many ways.

1st, I could regain my confidence as SW Engineer, 2nd it opened me new opportunities such as Best Reviewer and so one, 3rd, believe it or not, I think it also
helped me to get promotion, which I think maybe it will extend my working life in Samsung around 10 years if I want to.

then was it only 2 of them who I got support? actually I have more... some of them supported me mentally and some of them recommended me a book which helped me to 
change my mind to move foward. 

But I have to admit that it's not easy to meet those mentor of your life, because to meet those person, it should be perfect timing because 
either you are busy or not ready or they didn't have time to help you. So, If you could meet those person, I think you should be very thankful

Then, can we not be successful in life if we are not luck? I do not think so..

For me, apart from the mentor who helped me, I also had community for my personal growth. people in this community gave me a constructive feedback, and listen to me
whenever I want to practice and speak to them.

Especially during last 10 years, I improved my softskills a lot, communication, presentation, discussion, conference leading, you name it, almost all part of my soft
skill has improved.

it's not only for the English ability that you can improve, but if you are in this community for long time like me, you will realize that it's beyond that 
because you can get positive feedback from anyone in this community and they even volunteer to support you for certain issues.

You can even get luck to meet your mentor in this community as well.

Can you guess what this community is? Yes, it's Toastmasters Club. I know there are many other Toastmasters club in Korea, SOTM is also excellent 
place to get together. Yout know, Toastmasters program provide mentoring to the members, so if you ask, you will get one.

All you need is just be the bold faced person who can ask for help whenever necessary. If you find the person who you think best in that field, instead of being 
nice and not asking help, go and ask if they can help you. 

As long as you have gratitude, I'm sure they will be supportive in many way.

Why don't we grow together?

thanks.
