## Coach's communication

Understanding My communication style vs Recognizing the communication style of others? which one do you think more important?

For me, I think it's more important to recognize the communication style of others when it comes to the communication, why? because by understanding their communication style, I can tailor myself to be more suitable communicator so that I can see more about them. 

Do you remember the fact/emotion/needs picture I shared in previous picture?

When communicating as a coach, I need to switch myself to become more like active listener so that I can catch their emotion and understand the context of their story.

So, first 5 minutes of the conversation when coaching is very important, because I can identify what kind of communication style my client is. Next is to tailor my communication which is suitable and make them feel more comfortable to talk about their story.

Then what would be the next important thing in Coach's communication?

** Empathy **

Well, I have to tell you that having empathy toward your client is different from accepting or agreeing the emotion of your client unconditionally.
