## Coach's communication

Understanding My communication style vs Recognizing the communication style of others? which one do you think more important?

For me, I think it's more important to recognize the communication style of others when it comes to the communication, because I can change myself but not others.

Do you remember the fact/emotion/needs picture I shared in previous picture?

When communicating as a coach, I need to switch myself to become more like active listener so that I can catch their emotion and understand the context of their story.

So, first 5 minutes of the conversation when coaching is very important, because I can identify what kind of communication style my client is. Next is to tailor my communication style which is suitable and make them feel more comfortable to talk about their story.

Then what would be the next important thing in Coach's communication?

** Empathy **

Well, I have to tell you that having empathy toward your client is different from accepting or agreeing your client unconditionally.

Some people say that parents need to praise or compliment their child unconditionally, however what if they do something wrong? do the parents still need to compliment them?

For example, let's say that you have early 20 something years old child and after they entered college, you found that your child is coming back home around midnight  or just before the sun rise sometimes because she plays with her friends.

Since it continued more than half year, you want to do something so you sit down with your daughter and talked about it seriously. And believe it or not both of you agreed to come back home by 10 PM regardless of any circomstances. 

Wow, that's it it's good right? 

but what's happening after that day is that your daughter came home around 11 PM, hm..

what should I do? should I praise or compliment her? saying, oh my lovely daughter, I knew that you could do it. Thank you very much coming home early!

or sould I scold her because she couldn't keep the promise? What would be the right action?

carrot or whip ? which one should we use? 

We all know that both has some power but at the same time, both of them have limitation as well. If I compliment her, she may think oh.. 11 PM could be good enough, so I will keep the time as 11 PM not 10, on the other hand if I scold her, then she might lose the motivation because anyway she tried...

From Coach's perspective, what's needed for this kind of situation is empathy, you tell them I recognize you.

in this case, you talk to her that I have a high regard for you coming home before midnight today, I can see that you are trying to meet our agreement. But that's it.
no compliment, no praise what so ever to her action. 

This gives a clear point that I recognized that you do try to keep the promise but at the same time, we both know that it's not the one we agreed, so let's keep it up.

If it's something you can compliment, you say wow! amazing!, but if it's something that you have to show empathy not more than that, then way of the communication should keep that line.
