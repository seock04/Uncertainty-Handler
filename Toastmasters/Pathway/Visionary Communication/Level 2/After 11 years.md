I'm not sure how you feel about the Toastmasters club, but to me, it's like treasure box.

At first, it was the training field for me where I can actually practice public English speech and then, 
it became a play ground where I can meet my dear friends to have fun.
And now, It becomes, very special community where I can try something new and get life feedback to grow my self.

This kind of transition began since I started my Toastmasters journey and it's been 11 years now. and, as time goes by, as I told you, It
has changed it's usage in my life and although I do not know how it will be changed, I think it will be good to continue in the future 
because personally I think it will not be easier to meet good people in grown up society like us and people in this community uaually have amazing talent 
as well as the attractive characters so It's very hard to resist not to have good relationship with you.

and Among many good point, if I have to choose one reason why I want to keep this community alive, I want to say "people".

after I got older than 30 something years old, when I look back, it's not easy to meet positive and supportive person who are willing to help me 
when I'm in need of help.

Fortunately, in this club, systematically, it's designed to support you positively. For example, for the new comer, Toastmasters have system called mentoring program.

Wow, then did I have mentor? to be honest with you, I didn't have specific mentor who helped me through in the early stage of my toastmasters journey, but later with 
many members who I met in this club helped me and supported me in very different way.

how about... can you have your mentor? YES.

Fortunately, current SOTM has 4 x president as a member so I believe you can get mentor if you ask to VPE or President, even to me.


then what can you get from mentor? they will guide you how to user Toastmasters system on website, and how to get credit and importantly, they will give you the personal
feedback when you prepare your public speech.


how do you think? I think public speech is like riding a bicycle, It's still difficult to write an essay and practice it speak, but I do not think it's something you 
have to participate in class nor try to memorize like history.

you need to find your pattern of how to find items and write for speech then practice for speech. In this process, mentor can surely help you with their experiences and
if you practice it more then you will grow more, and when the time comes, just like riding a bicycle, you will get to your your own way to settle in.

Feb. 1, 2012, It was the day I started my Toastmaster membership, and it's been 11 years so far.

Although I didn't have explicit mentor, and I know I had been bad mentor sometimes and good for others. But yet, I was fortunate that I had many friends like mentor 
who were always open for the talk and supported me with possitive energy.

If you have will there will be a way.. and if you want to have Toastmaster mentor, let me know, I will find mentor for you.. or I can help you for it.

Thanks.
