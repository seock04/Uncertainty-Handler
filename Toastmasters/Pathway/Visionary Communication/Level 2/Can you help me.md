When I first join the Toastmasters, there was no pathway system and not so many people were refering to the toastmasters online website.
I think it was because 2 books were being delivered to all the new members called Competent communication, Competent Leadership, 
and actually, as far as i know, since 90% of the Toastmasters were not able to complete these two, people didn't really care about others but 
try to have fun with those.

And if you had difficult time to do something with it, you just pay a visit to VPE or VPM or even the president of club to give you guide about how to do or what to do for the
assignment in that book. During that time, the key was finding officers to ask questions but sometimes even that was hard because officers are doing something else.

That's why Toastmasters had system called mentorship program.

How about now, I'm sure we do have toastmasters mentoring program now as well, but I think it's also up to you because some people might prefer searching online better than 
asking for assigning mentor and see them face to face.

How about you? 

Toastmasters are very proactive community and people are usually kind enough to support you. If you want to do in this club.

However, sometimes, members feel burden when they are asked to do something in the club or asked to take officers role, so they feel like take times as much as possible 
and move slow in their own pace.

I think this is one very clever way of going for the Toastmasters journey because it's very long endless journey. if you feel tired and can sufficient energe for it, 
then you might be out of it before you can actually achieve the goal you had when you first join the Toastmasters.

So, from my point, It's important to move in your pace and ask for help to the right person whenever it's necessary. That is the key for Toastmasters life.

How about you? are you satisfied with your own toastmasters journey now?

What was your goal when you first came to this club? was it a having proficiency of English speaking? or being able to have good public speech? 

For me, it changed as time goes by, and I always had good friends in Toastmasters club who supported me during this transition and I think they were the good mentor for me

In Korea, we didn't have such a community type growth platform where people can help each other for their goal and cheer each other up. 
In this community, cooperation is more likely happen than competition, because all the role taking, position of the officiers are volunteering work and their purpose is to 
support your personal growth.

well.. actually I am supposed to tell you about my mentoring experiences from Toastmasters club, but I didn't have such a gift. But because of those friends who said 
yes to me when I ask for help in the club, and I had courageous to ask for help, I could continue the journey until now and I feel very much thankful for that.

Thanks.
