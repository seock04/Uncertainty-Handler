## Coaching in Leadership

Today, I want to talk about 2 things, one is about what I learned with my leadership style checking, the current version of me, and the second is what kind of leadership style I'm pursueing these day.

I tested myself with the leadership style this project provided, and the result is...
And top most 2 were.. Democratic and Coaching
Does it make sense, I mean, since you guys have experienced me for more than couple of years, do you agree on it? 

personally, I can agree, because those are the easiest leadership style I can think of and I feel comfortable when I'm working like that.

Although I reminded myself what kind of leadership style I have, I don't think that's all, understanding my leadership style can give me what I'm good at and not good at but the point is.. "are you flexible with it". Can I switch my leadership style which can make most out of the circomstances?

some people might say, authoritative/dictatorian leadership may not be good because it's hirachecal, and it's not following the trend. 

but understanding the benefits and disadvantage of those style is still important and in a certain context, you may see it's more efficient, you never know, so becoming a leader who understand their version of leader and can switch their leadership style to fit in for the circomstance sometimes are the one I thought I need to be..

and the second story is about the recent ah ha moment that I want to share with you

let me ask you a question first, "if your friend who is using 22만원 keyboard, said to you that I want to change my keyboard now I feel pain on my neck and right sholders with it I don't think it's right for me".

what would you say to him? 

when he came to you, he acted like this (목과 어깨를 감싸며 옴)

You know he is not liying, but it's also true that his keyboard is one of the best keyboard in the world.

if we hear the story until here, some of you may say, what on earth are you talking about, you stopid, go to clinic, do not waste your money on your keyboard, you already have the good one man!

am I right? 

well, to tell you the truth, I am this friend, haha

my point is this, I actually had constant pain on my neck and right shoulder, and because my keyboard type had 10 key with numbers, it was too long which resulted me with bad body posture, like this, so after about 5~6 months I bought pain has grown bigger and bigger and bigger.

the funny thing is, I went to 한의원, 물리치료실, hospitals literally every place but it was only for a day that I could ease the pain but it didn't last longer.
but once I changed my keyboard, just after a few days, my pain went a way. funny isn't it?

The lesson I've learned is this..

What I say in conversation may tell you the truth but maybe it's not what really people needs, usually what people say is fact, we think fact is the most important thing, however, it's just tip of iceberg, so if you are the leader, you need to practice to see the emotion underneath the fact, and while having conversation, find the real needs.

and for those who thought, it's ridiculous to connect neck pain with keyboard, try not to judge the people next you but talk to them with good will, do not judge inside your head but have curiosty toward the person you are dealing with, then you will find the real needs.

I'm not saying that you have to be like this all day, but just try when you think you are in leader's position. Don't think you can be like this in a one day, you need to do the practice.

But if you consistantly try.. then you will be an good leader one day. How do I know? I know.. and I believe that all of you have potential to be a good leader.

Thanks.
