This is a story of how Gaming Hub was born and what I have learned in last 1 and half years.

I decided to talk about it because it was kind of turning point in my career as SW engineer 
and I felt it's also important to remind myself one more time which I felt about it.

It was around 2020 december when I first heard about the Gaming Hub, it was very early stage where there was nothing clearly decided yet.
Only the concept document exist and Service PM was drawing pictures with their imagination.

At first design, Gaming Hub was almost like PS5 or Xbox console, they wanted almost all the feature that console had.
For example, playing game is default and they wanted the delay of game that usually cloud gamer experience, which we usually call as latency is minimized.

How much?

which gamer may feel same as when they play console game. Hu hu..

If you are a gamer who already have experiences of enjoying cloud game, you may know how crazy it is.. because latency is
inevitable and it can not be compared to the console when it comes to the latency because usually game in console is already downloaded and played 
but cloud game is actually running on the cloud server and stream the result on device. 

so if user press the button it takes time to send those event to the cloud server and vice versa.

anyway, it was beginning of the chaose for us.

later they wanted gamer's chatting app integration called Discord. Is there anyone who knows about it? it's social chatting service which gamer's love to use now.
They also wanted to Music feature which user can play while playing game.

more seriously, at first we didn't have confirmed cloud game partner so we were fighting to work with nothing on hands.

it took around 6 month to know that we will have around 5 cloud game partner and took another couple of more month that Discord disagreed to join us.

fortunatelly Spotify accepted deal we propsed and we could start discussion to make new service.
